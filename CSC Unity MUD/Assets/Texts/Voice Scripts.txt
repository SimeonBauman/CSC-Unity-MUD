// Opening text

Hey you, you're finally awake
What are you doing? get up 

When you are ready come over here

It would seem like we are trapped in this dungeon.
Unfortunately, I am too cool to get us out.
We are surrounded by monsters and it is up to you to set us free.
Lucky for you I came prepared.
I just so happen to be cool enough that I have weapons for you.
But they aren't free.
You must give me souls for better weapons.
You can get souls by killing monsters.
I'll even give you a great deal for your first weapon, your soul for this wooden stick.
What do you think?
