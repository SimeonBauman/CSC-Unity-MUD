Hey you, you're finally awake
What are you doing? get up 

When you are ready come over here

It would seem like we are trapped in this dungeon.
Unfortunately, I am too cool to get us out.
We are surrounded by monsters and it is up to you to set us free.
Lucky for you I came prepared.
I just so happen to be cool enough that I have weapons for you.
But they aren't free.
You must give me souls for better weapons.
You can get souls by killing monsters.
I'll even give you a great deal for your first weapon, your soul for this wooden stick.
What do you think?
Oh you can't talk.
Well in my mind you said yes, so here you go.
Now go get more souls!

You want to buy something?

What can I get you?

That was quite the deal.

Good Choice.

You have been healed.

You should be healthy now.

You can now call me by pressing space.

Congrats, your weapon is now stronger.

Ok, I upgraded your weapon.

Looks like you don't have enough souls for that.

You already bought that.
